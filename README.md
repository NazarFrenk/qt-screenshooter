# Qt Screenshooter
## Description
The program creates a screenshot every minute (start/stop performed by a button). Each new snapshot is compared with previous snapshot and displays the result in % of how similar two snapshots (newly created and previous) are to each other. The first snapshot always has 0% because there is nothing to compare it to.

## How to run
For Windows just need to download and unpack release.rar from https://github.com/NazarFrenk/qt-screenshooter/releases/tag/1.0.0.
